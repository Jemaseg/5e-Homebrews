**Power Source**: The heart of an air genasi ship is its elemental core, where a bound wind elemental resides. This sentient force of air can be bound to the ship through a pact, offering its power in exchange for care and the freedom to roam the skies, or can be captured and forced into the elemental core.

**Navigation and Control**: Skilled air genasi elementalists, known as Windcallers, communicate with the bound elemental to direct the ship. Using a combination of wind magic and physical tools like wind rudders and sails, they can maneuver the ship with remarkable precision.
